This was a game made in about 24 hours for the MULE Game Jam 2018 at the University of Missouri. It took first place. It's a 2D platformer with a grappling hook mechanic/gimmick.
Made in Unity 2017.

A demo can be found in the `build` folder, which represents the state of the game upon presentation at the end of the Game Jam.
